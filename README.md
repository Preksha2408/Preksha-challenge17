## The challenge


User Story

AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile

## Usage-Instructions

1. Access the deployed GitHub Gist link.

2. Read through the introductory paragraph and summary.

3. Navigate through the table of contents to explore the different sections of the tutorial.

4. Read and understand each component of the regex pattern.

5. Apply the knowledge gained from the tutorial in your own projects.

## Installation 

* Set up a GitHub Gist:

1. Sign in to your GitHub account or create one if you haven't already.
2. Visit: https://gist.github.com/ to create a new Gist.
3. In the "Gist description" field, enter a brief description of the challenge, such as "Email Regex Challenge".
4. Add a new file to the Gist by clicking on "Add file" and give it a suitable name, like "email_regex_challenge.md".
5. In your newly created Gist, write a brief explanation of the regex, describing each component and its purpose in the 
   email validation process.
6. Explain how the regex can be modified to accept new requirements, such as uppercase letters or additional special 
   characters in the email address.
7. Share your Gist:

Once you have completed the explanation and modifications to the regex, save your Gist by clicking on "Create public Gist" or "Create secret Gist" as per your preference.
Share the link to your Gist with others to discuss different approaches and understanding of the regex.

These sources provided valuable information on the construction and usage of regex patterns for email validation, as well as insights into the pedagogical aspects of teaching regex to new coders and other academics. This knowledge was incorporated into the creation of the comprehensive tutorial, which aimed to provide an accessible yet academically rigorous explanation of email validation using regex.
